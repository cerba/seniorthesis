* Learn about github pull requests, which are very useful to
communicate code changes.  If you work in a branche, you can issue a
pull request if/when you would like me to review your changes.

* Copy files from IC to FNAL.  You have to figure out where to put the
files at FNAL.  "dCache" "EOS" "Resilient" "Blue Arc" are some words I
have heard associated with disk space at FNAL in the past, but I'm no
expert.  Copy command possibilities are:
> lcg-cp
> srmcp
> xrdcp
> dccp

### Will look into this more, but I've read the man pages for lcg-cp. 
###It says that I need a source file and then a destination file, but I'm not sure I understand how to set that up properly. 
###Is the source file the one that begins with root://, as shown in the text file, or is it the one that begins /pnfs/hep.ph.ic.uk.... that is listed in the TOP Database at Cern (second link in the "Links" email)? 
###Do I have to create a root file in my directory to send it to?



* To set up ROOT in python:
import ROOT as r      # import the PyROOT library
r.gROOT.SetBatch(1)   # Run in batch mode, so you don't waste time trying to open X11 connections
r.gInterpreter.GenerateDictionary('vector<ROOT::Math::LorentzVector<ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiM4D<Double32_t> > >','vector;Math/LorentzVector.h') # This generates the dictionary for vectors of 4-vectors (needed to read elP4,muP4,genP4,jetP4,etc.), and creates some annoying looking files in your folder that you don't need to keep in the repository.

### Got it.


Initial TTree branches of interest:
genP4
genPdgId
genMotherIndex
genMotherPdgId

For a given event, you can loop over them with an index

for i in range(nEvents) :
   chain.GetEntry(i)
   for j in range(len(chain.genPdgId)) :
      print j, chain.genPdgId[j], chain.genP4[j].pt(), chain.genP4[j].eta(), chain.genMotherPdgId[j], chain.genMotherIndex[j]


* The angle between two 4-vectors v1 and v2 is most easily accessed with the r.Math.VectorUtil.CosTheta(v1,v2) function.
